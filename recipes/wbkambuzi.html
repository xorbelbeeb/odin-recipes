                    <li><strong>Garlic cloves: </strong>about six or seven, minced up fine, to add a kick that'll blow your mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea salt: </strong>about two tablespoons, to bring out the flavor without any doubt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water: </strong>enough to cover the chilis, so they can ferment and get real chill.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honey or sugar: </strong>a tablespoon or two, to give it that sweetness that'll stick like glue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Apple cider vinegar: </strong>a splash or more, to add some tanginess that'll make you soar.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Now, let's get down to business with the steps to make this sauce and feel like a culinary boss:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop up those Kambuzi chilis real nice and fine, so they can release all their heat and shine.</li>
                <li>Toss 'em in a jar with the garlic and sea salt, then give it a shake like it's nobody's fault.</li>
                <li>Pour in the water 'til it covers the mix, then seal it up tight and give it a quick fix.</li>
                <li>Let it sit for about a week or two, in a cool, dark place where it can do what it do.</li>
                <li>When it's good and funky and fermented just right, blend it all up 'til it's smooth and tight.</li>
                <li>Add in the honey or sugar for a touch of sweet, then splash in the vinegar to make it complete.</li>
                <li>Give it a taste and adjust as you please, then bottle it up and get ready to tease.</li>

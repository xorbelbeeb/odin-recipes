        <div><img source=".img/pina.jpg" alt="A pineapple, two habaneros, and a bottle of fresh made piña colonoscopy sauce"></div>
        <h3>Just about the last thing you'll ever taste!</h3>
            <p>Alright, folks, buckle up for a wild ride into the realm of fiery flavors with a sauce I like to call "Piña Colonoscopy." Now, grab your aviators and strap in tight, 'cause we're about to take a trip down the habañero highway with a twist of tropical delight.</p>
        <h3>First off, here's what you'll need for this psychedelic concoction:</h3>
            <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pineapple: </strong>2 cups of chopped pineapple, ripe and ready to rumble.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coconut milk: </strong>1 cup of coconut milk, straight from the nipples of the majestic coconut palm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Habañero peppers: </strong>6-8 habañero peppers, depending on how brave you're feeling and how long ago you had your last prostate exam.</li>
                    <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>3 cloves of garlic, because everything's better with garlic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lime: </strong>1 lime, squeezed for that zesty kick to the tastebuds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vinegar: </strong>A splash of vinegar, to keep things funky fresh. White wine, apple cider, or really any vinegar will do, but the darker colored vinegar will result in a darker sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt as always, to balance out the chaos.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This sauce isn't just a flavor experience, it's a journey—a wild, untamed adventure through the jungles of taste sensation. And much like a colonoscopy, it's not for the faint of heart. So brace yourselves, adventurers.</p>
        <h3>Now, let's get this freak show on the road with the steps to flavor town:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat up a skillet and throw in your chopped pineapple, letting it sizzle and caramelize until it's golden brown and bursting with tropical sweetness.</li>
                <li>Add in the coconut milk, stirring it into the pineapple party like you're mixing up a Mai Tai on the beach at sunset.</li>
                <li>Toss in those habañero peppers, seeds and all, and watch out 'cause things are about to get hot, hot, hot!</li>
                <li>Crush up the garlic cloves and toss 'em in the mix, letting their pungent aroma infuse the sauce with a kick of savory goodness.</li>
                <li>Squeeze in the juice of that lime, adding a splash of citrusy brightness to cut through the heat and send your taste buds into orbit.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in a pinch of salt to balance out the flavors, because even in the midst of madness, we strive for harmony.</li>
                <li>Let everything simmer and mingle together for about 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened up and the flavors have melded into a symphony of sensory overload.</li>
                <li>Finally, give it a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your liking, then blend it all up into a smooth and spicy elixir that'll set your soul on fire.</li>
            </ol>
